After analyzing dealer schedules and player participations on the days when casino suffers losses, 
I strongly believe that dealer Billy Jones and player Mylie Schmidt are colluding to scam Luck Duck.

Luck Duck suffers a total of 13 losses at the the exact date and time when dealer Billy Jones and player Mylie Schmidt are both at the same table.
